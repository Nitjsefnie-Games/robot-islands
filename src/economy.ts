// Pure economy math: event-driven piecewise integration per SPEC §15.3.
//
// No PixiJS, no DOM. Functions take an `IslandState` and mutate its
// `inventory`, `xp`, `level`, `unspentSkillPoints`, and `lastTick` fields.
// The pure shape makes the loop independently testable and the offline-catchup
// path (§15.5) trivially correct — the same loop handles 1 frame and 24 hours.
//
// Why event-driven: a naive `dt × rate` step over the whole interval would
// overshoot caps (e.g., produce 101 iron_ore when cap is 100) and consume
// inputs after they've gone to zero. Splitting at events keeps each segment
// linear and exact. The integration converges in O(events × resources)
// regardless of `now - lastTick`, so multi-day offline catchup is cheap.

 * §4 ocean-layer (Task 10) — check an ocean platform's preconditions and
 * return the `PausedReason` if the building should halt this tick, or `null`
 * if it should proceed. Mutates `b.paused` in place so the inspector and
 * persistence layer see the same value the economy used.
 *
 * Two failure modes, mirroring the §4 design doc edge cases:
 *
 *   1. `'anchor-depopulated'`: `b.anchorIslandId` names a missing island OR
 *      one whose `populated` flag is false. Set this also when the caller
 *      didn't thread a `world` reference (defensive: with no world the
 *      anchor lookup can't run, and an ocean platform whose anchor is
 *      unresolvable must not silently produce — its output has no destination
 *      and its power draw has no pool).
 *   2. `'terrain-lost'`: the platform's geographic cell is no longer ocean
 *      (an island's footprint now overlaps it). Defensive — not expected
 *      in initial scope but cheap to detect.
 *
 * The platform's `b.x, b.y` are island-local tile coords on the anchor
 * (matching the existing per-building convention — `b.x, b.y` is relative
 * to `IslandSpec.cx, cy`). We convert to world-tile coords via
 * `anchor.cx + b.x` (resp. y) and sample `isOceanTile` once at the
 * platform's anchor tile. The placement validator already enforced full-
 * cell ocean coverage at place time, so the per-tick sentinel here is
 * "did anything change at the anchor tile?" A future biome / land-
 * reclamation event could shrink the sampling rigour if needed.
 *
 * NOT a paused reason: power brownout. A platform whose anchor pool has
 * insufficient W falls through the existing §5.1 brownout mechanic
 * (`powerFactor < 1`) — the building stays "active" with degraded rate
 * rather than fully halting. The §4 design doc explicitly calls this out
 * ("Anchor pool has no power: platform halts via the existing brownout
 * mechanic (no new paused reason)").

 * integrates at the start-of-segment factor; since the linear ramp is
 * monotonically DECREASING, that over-estimates production within the ramp.
 * The `MAINTENANCE_RAMP_SEGMENTS` constant in `maintenance.ts` bounds the
